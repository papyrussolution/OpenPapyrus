/*
 * Log record types.  Note that these are *not* alphabetical.  This is
 * intentional so that we don't change the meaning of values between
 * software upgrades.
 *
 * EXPECTED, UNEXPECTED, IGNORE, and OK are used in the txnlist functions.
 * Here is an explanation of how the statuses are used.
 *
 * TXN_OK
 *	BEGIN records for transactions found on the txnlist during
 *	OPENFILES (BEGIN records are those with a prev_lsn of 0,0)
 *
 * TXN_COMMIT
 *	Transaction committed and should be rolled forward.
 *
 * TXN_ABORT
 *	This transaction's changes must be undone.  Either there was
 *	never a prepare or commit record for this transaction OR there
 *	was a commit, but we are recovering to a timestamp or particular
 *	LSN and that point is before this transaction's commit.
 *
 * TXN_PREPARE
 *	Prepare record, but no commit record is in the log.
 *
 * TXN_IGNORE
 *	Generic meaning is that this transaction should not be
 *	processed during later recovery passes.  We use it in a
 *	number of different manners:
 *
 *	1. We never saw its BEGIN record.  Therefore, the logs have
 *	   been reclaimed and we *know* that this transaction doesn't
 *	   need to be aborted, because in order for it to be
 *	   reclaimed, there must have been a subsequent checkpoint
 *	   (and any dirty pages for this transaction made it to
 *	   disk).
 *
 *	2. This is a child transaction that created a database.
 *	   For some reason, we don't want to recreate that database
 *	   (i.e., it already exists or some other database created
 *	   after it exists).
 *
 *	3. During recovery open of subdatabases, if the master check fails,
 *	   we use a TXN_IGNORE on the create of the subdb in the nested
 *	   transaction.
 *
 *	4. During a remove, the file with the name being removed isn't
 *	   the file for which we are recovering a remove.
 *
 * TXN_EXPECTED
 *	After a successful open during recovery, we update the
 *	transaction's status to TXN_EXPECTED.  The open was done
 *	in the parent, but in the open log record, we record the
 *	child transaction's ID if we also did a create.  When there
 *	is a valid ID in that field, we use it and mark the child's
 *	status as TXN_EXPECTED (indicating that we don't need to redo
 *	a create for this file).
 *
 *	When recovering a remove, if we don't find or can't open
 *	the file, the child (which does the remove) gets marked
 *	EXPECTED (indicating that we don't need to redo the remove).
 *
 * TXN_UNEXPECTED
 *	During recovery, we attempted an open that should have succeeded
 *	and we got ENOENT, so like with the EXPECTED case, we indicate
 *	in the child that we got the UNEXPECTED return so that we do redo
 *	the creating/deleting operation.
